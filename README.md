# dev-tools
Repository to store useful development tools, aliases, scripts and other cli customizations

# macOS apps/extensions
- [Arc](https://arc.net/gift/d3e716f3) is **the** best browser for Mac (and soon Windows). Fight me about it.
- [Maccy](maccy.app) is a clipboard manager for macOS. 
- [Hand Mirror](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hand-mirror/id1502839586?mt=12) provides a menu bar icon that, when clicked, shows you your own handsome face through your webcam. The pro version (â‚¬6,99) lets you - among other features - save precious menu bar space by opening the 'mirror' when you click your (M-series) Mac's notch!

# Terminal emulator
I'm using [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/EJNDZ6) as my terminal emulator, and I think you should too. There's a bunch of cool features, but my favorites are IDE-like input formatting and Warp AI, specifically the hashtag feature. `# move foo.bar to a new directory foobar` becomes `mkdir foobar && mv foo.bar foobar/foo.bar`.

# Terminal utilities I love
- [git open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open) opens your current repo on GitHub (or Lab or w/e)
- [aicommits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits) uses GPT-3.5 to generate commit messages. Check [aliases.sh](https://github.com/mennoliefstingh/dev-tools/aliases/aliases.sh) for a good config.
